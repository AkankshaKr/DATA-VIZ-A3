Credit Card Fraud Analysis and Visualization (2019-2020)
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of fraudulent credit card transactions in the United States during 2019 and 2020. Using a dataset of over 1.85 million transactions, the project explores the intricate dynamics of fraud across temporal, geographical, demographic, and behavioral dimensions. By combining advanced data visualization techniques with statistical analysis and machine learning, this work uncovers critical insights to enhance fraud detection systems.

Project Objectives:
Fraud Distribution Analysis: Investigate fraud occurrences across states, cities, and demographic groups, identifying geographical hotspots and high-risk categories.
Temporal and Seasonal Trends: Analyze fraud patterns over time using area charts, violin plots, and time-series forecasting (SARIMA and ARIMA models).
Demographic Insights: Examine trends by gender, generation, and job categories through treemaps, donut charts, and density scatter plots.
Merchant and Transaction Analysis: Highlight fraud-prone merchant categories and transaction characteristics using violin plots, scatter plots, and treemaps.
Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models for fraud detection, addressing data imbalance through resampling and class-weight adjustments. Evaluate performance with metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, and confusion matrices.
Key Features:
Visual Analysis Tools:
Geospatial: Heatmaps, bar charts, and treemaps reveal state-wise and city-specific fraud trends.
Temporal: Time-series analysis captures vulnerabilities during specific hours and seasons.
Demographic: Generational and occupational insights identify key fraud-prone groups.
Behavioral: Patterns in transaction amounts and categories highlight systemic vulnerabilities.
Machine Learning Models: Fraud detection using classification algorithms, evaluated for accuracy and robustness.
Comparative Analysis: Year-over-year trends between 2019 and 2020, demonstrating the evolution of fraud activities.
Dataset Details:
The dataset includes detailed information about credit card transactions, such as transaction time, amount, merchant category, customer demographics, and geographical coordinates. Additional engineered features include generational cohorts, transaction hour distributions, fraud ratios, and per capita fraud occurrences.

Technical Stack:
Programming & Libraries: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau for advanced visualization.
Machine Learning Models: Classifiers and time-series models evaluated with statistical metrics.
Visualization Techniques: Heatmaps, treemaps, density scatter plots, violin plots, and area charts.

Project Outcomes:
The findings of this analysis provide actionable insights for improving fraud detection systems by identifying high-risk groups, vulnerable time windows, and fraud-prone transaction categories. The project demonstrates the power of combining data visualization and machine learning to tackle real-world challenges.
